* Tasks
** TODO non-top background estimation
*** TODO obtain extrapolation function
*** DONE implement extrapolation
*** TODO closure test in 1b0t control region
*** TODO check why 0t1b control region looks odd
**

** TODO implement electron+jets channel
*** TODO run preselection
*** TODO run analysis
*** TODO run background estimation + closure test 

* Object Definition
** DONE figure out if I should apply isolation on veto level (i.e. at object definition) 
no, because this might reject events with bjets as well
** Objects

- electron: veto iso ID, pt > 30GeV, |eta| < 2.5
- muon: loose ID, pt > 30GeV, |eta| < 2.5, iso < 0.15
- ak4-jet: tight ID, pt > 30GeV, |eta| < 2.5 (used for b-tagging)
- HOTVR-jet: pt > 200GeV, |eta| < 2.4 (used for top-tagging and b* reco)

* Analysis Strategy
** PreSelection
*** Cuts

- isoMu24 || isoTkMu24 Triggers
- 1 tight-ID muon: pt > 53GeV
- additional lepton veto:
- MET > 50GeV
- ST > 400GeV
- 1+ HOTVR Jet

** Reconstruction

*** W reconstruction
**** TODO maybe use Daniel's kinematic fit instead?    
Combine muon four-vector and MET assuming W is produced on-shell. If
solution is complex, only real part is considered.

*** top reconstruction

Use HOTVR jet as top hypothesis. Additional top tagging requirements
are imposed in the signal region.

** Signal Regions

All signal regions require exactly one HOTVR jet fulfilling the top
tagging criteria. Two different signal regions are then defined
according to the number of ak4 jets fulfilling the loose b-tag
criterion.
1. (main signal region) 1 b-tagged jets
2. (ttbar enriched region) 2+ b-tagged jets

** Background Estimation

The main backgrounds of this analysis are
1. ttbar (semi-leptonic)
2. b or t tag fakes (mostly W+Jets, little DY, Diboson, QCD)
3. single t (tW-channel)

The single t and ttbar backgrounds are estimated from Monte-Carlo
simulations. The normalization is constrained by fitting
these backgrounds in both signal regions simulatneously.

The non-t backgrounds arise from misidentified objects, mostly from
W+Jets but also from DY+Jets, Di-Boson nd QCD. These Backgrounds are
expected to be not well described in the signal region. Hence, the
background contribution from misidentified objects is estimated, by
extrapolating the non-top SM backgrounds from a separate control
region. The extrapolation is performed using the \alpha method. In
this method, a extrapolation function for the background is obtained
via a fit to the ratio of the background in the signal region to the
background in the control region. A linear function is assumed to
describe this ratio.
